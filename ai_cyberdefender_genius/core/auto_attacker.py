"""
Auto Attacker Module
-------------------

This module is designed to proactively identify, infiltrate, and neutralize malicious users or attackers
who attempt to compromise the AI-CyberDefender-Genius application or its users. It leverages expert knowledge
of Linux systems and advanced attack techniques to act with precision and authority.

Features:
- Comprehensive understanding of Linux system internals and commands
- Automated reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning
- Exploitation of identified weaknesses with advanced payloads
- Stealthy operation to avoid detection and countermeasures
- Continuous learning and adaptation to new threats and defenses
