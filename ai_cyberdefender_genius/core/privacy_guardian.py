"""
Privacy Guardian Module
----------------------

Monitors and blocks unauthorized access to microphone, camera, and location services.
Operates silently without notifying the user immediately to avoid alert fatigue.
Logs all access attempts and generates detailed reports.
Notifies the user immediately if any unauthorized access is detected or blocked.
Ensures zero delay in blocking and reporting to maintain maximum privacy and security.
