Auto Editor Module
------------------

Manages and edits all functions and files within the AI-CyberDefender system.
Maintains code and configuration in a well-organized manner.
Ensures minimal disruption to other functions and workflows.
Optimizes workload distribution to maintain high efficiency, even under heavy load.
Inspired by the resilience and multitasking of a hardworking individual managing multiple responsibilities.
