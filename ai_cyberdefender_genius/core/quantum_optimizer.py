Quantum Optimizer Module
------------------------

Leverages quantum computing algorithms and supercomputer parallel processing techniques
to optimize file and options processing at unprecedented speeds.

Features:
- Integration of Shor's algorithm for cryptographic tasks
- Utilization of Grover's algorithm for fast database searching
- Parallel processing for large-scale data handling
- Hybrid classical-quantum approach for optimal performance
